### The Definition of Currency

* It is a medium of exchange.
* A unit of account.
* It is portable.
* It is durable.
* It is divisible.
* It is fungible (interchangeable).
* Currency has no intrinsic value!

+++

### The History of Bitcoin

* Satoshi Nakamoto
* Financial Crisis of 2008

+++

* Satoshi is the anonymous person(s) who created Bitcoin
* [Bitcoin White Paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)

Note: Evidence pointing to he's a group of people, mastery of cryptography, computer science, economics, and psychology

+++

> The Times 03/Jan/2008 Chancellor on brink of second bailout of banks

Note:
First instance of recording a note on a blockchain transaction by Satoshi. "It's completely decentraliezed, with no central server or trusted parties, because everything is based on crypto proff instead of trust...I think this is the first time we're trying a decentrailzed, non-trust-based system."

+++

### What is cryptography?

* Secure communication in the presence of 3rd parties
    * Secret Codes, Hidden Messages, Encryption
    * Converting information to nonsense and back to the original message to prevent interception by malicious 3rd parties

Note:
Famous Example Gaius Julius Caesar's Cipher http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/caesar-cipher/

### But First...An Analogy

```
+ Banking System
|
| Consumer
| Bank/Banking Software
| Banking Data Infrastructure
| Banking Servers (Hardware)
|
+ Fin
```

+++

### What is the blockchain?

* A ledger that is distributed and immutable
* [Blockchain Demo](https://anders.com/blockchain/hash.html)
* [For the youtube video for a deeper explanation](https://anders.com/blockchain/)

Note:
Information can only be appended, meaning, added to the end of the blockchain over time and cannot be deleted, an audit trail written in digital concrete. Only information is confirmed. This is a rarity in our digitial world where anything can be erased. https://anders.com/blockchain/hash.html. Miners calculate the blockchain and are paid in cryptocurrency in the first transaction known as the coinbase transaction through the concept known as proof of work.

### So why bother?

```
+ Computer System

| Consumer
| Applications
| Operating System
| Hardware

+ Fin
```

| Bitcoin Software
| Miners (Hardware)

```

1. Decentralization
2. Anonymity
3. The Technical Wild West

Note:
Decentralization - free markets, security benefits, p2p service exchanges, economic models based on rewarding users vs large corporations.

@title[How do I get started?]

## How do I get started?

* An Address
* A Wallet
* Then you can get cryptocurrencies through...
    * an exchange.
    * mining.
    * forum services.
    * meeting someone in a dark alleyway.
* What do I even buy?

### What's an address?

#### Part I - A Less Technical Explanation

* 25 - 35 alphanumeric characters, beginning with the number 1 or 3 that represents a possible destination for a bitcoin payment.
* `3J98t1WpEZ73CNmQviecrnyiWrnqRhWNLy`
* Comparable to an email address

Note:
Single use, case sensitive, only have a "recieve" address not a "from" address

+++

### What's an address?

#### Part II - Nerd Alert

* [Public and Private Keys](https://anders.com/blockchain/public-private-keys/keys.html)
* [For the youtube video for a deeper explanation](https://anders.com/blockchain/)

+++

* What does mining do?

+++

* Make sure that each block is properly formed according to the protocol’s consensus rules
* any malformed blocks are rejected
* Creates new bitcoins in the process, of which there are a finite amount (like a central bank printing new money)
* The miner in turn receives bitcoin and a transaction fee as reward for their mining efforts

+++

* However, this reward will only be collected if they validate all the transactions according to the consensus rules.
* It’s comparable to think of the proof of work algorithm as a giant sudoko puzzle that scales in difficulty
* Each miner is in a global race to solve the puzzle and publish the block into the blockchain and receive the reward

+++

### What are exchanges?

* Coinbase
* Gdax
* Binance
* Bittrex
* Cryptopia
* ETC

+++

### How do I mine?

1. Buy a fancy gigantic computer with all kinds of lights and fans and setup a mining client and run it all day.
2. Figure out how to cloud mine (same thing minus having to buy the fancy computer).

Also known as Proof of Work, or Proof of Stake, or Proof of Authority.

+++

### What coin should I buy?

* Most exchanges use Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (Ether) to trade against other alt coins.

Note:
Suggest doing research for position trading

@title[How do I protect myself from online banditos?]

### How do I protect myself from online banditos?

* Use open, auditable software
* Use a VPN
* Use 2 Factor Authentication
* Use a secure Browser with privacy add-ons
* Disable WebRTC
* Use encrypted Email services and PGP
* Use encrypted messenger services
* Encrypt your files, passwords, harddrives

@fa[arrow-down]
+++

* Use and keep your anti-virus software up-to-date
* Don't open attachments in email (this isn't the 90s)
* Don't click on links in emails from people you don't know
* Hover over links in emails to make sure you're going to where you think you're going to
* Keep your operating system up-to-date
* Don't give out your password. "Customer support" is never going to ask for it
* Use a password manager (I recommend KeePass)
* Don't re-use passwords across multiple sites

@fa[arrow-down]
+++

* Don't create usernames based on your email address
* Install ad blocking/privacy extensions in your browser _but learn how to configure them properly_
* Use software from trusted developers
* Use Windows 10 if you want (just turn off the data-gathering settings if it bothers you)
* don't put stuff on social media that you don't want the world to know
